# Pixy

```
In this paper, we present Pixy, the first open source tool for statically detecting XSS vulnerabilities in PHP 4 code by means of data flow analysis. We chose PHP as target language since it is widely used for designing Web applications, and a substantial number of security advisories refer to PHP programs. Although our prototype is aimed at the detection of XSS flaws, it can be equally applied to other taint-style vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or command injection.

## Before using

```
Currently, Pixy does not support object-oriented features
of PHP. Each use of object member variables and methods
is treated in an optimistic way, meaning that malicious data
can never arise from such constructs.
```

## Download


```
1. sudo apt install ant graphviz
2. git clone https://github.com/emavgl/pixy
3. cd pixy
4. ant build
```

## How to run

```bash
./run.sh /opt/lampp/htdocs/inventory-management-system/dashboard.php
```


The results will be in `pixy/graphs`.

This command will run Pixy on the only *dashboard* page.
Unfortunately, there is no page that include all the others.
So you have to run the script for all of them.

```bash
python3 run-all-folder.py /opt/lampp/htdocs/inventory-management-system/ output-folder
```

### Convert .dot to images

```bash
dot -Tjpg file._min.dot > outputfile.jpg
```
